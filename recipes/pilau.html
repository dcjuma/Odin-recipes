    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The dish combines rice with aromatic spices, chicken or beef. It adds depth to the plainness of white rice or brown rice or generally just rice as most would perceive</p>
        <p>It is necessary to point out that it is a traditionally spicy dish and therefore might not be recommended to people with hyperacidity or other digestive problems. However, if you are clear and would like to impress with your cooking skills then be my guest.</p>
